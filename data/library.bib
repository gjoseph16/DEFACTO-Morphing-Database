abstract = {[1] This paper develops a new approach to identify hydrologic indicators related to fish community and generate a quantitative function between an ecological target index and the identified hydrologic indicators. The approach is based on genetic programming (GP), a data mining method. Using the Shannon Index (a fish community diversity index) or the number of individuals (total abundance) of a fish community, as an ecological target, the GP identified the most ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators (ERHIs) from 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration, for the case study site, the upper Illinois River. Robustness analysis showed that different GP runs found a similar set of ERHIs; each of the identified ERHI from different GP runs had a consistent relationship with the target index. By comparing the GP results with those from principal component analysis and autecology matrix, the three approaches identified a small number (six) of common ERHIs. Particularly, the timing of low flow (D min) seems to be more relevant to the diversity of the fish community, while the magnitude of the low flow (Qb) is more relevant to the total fish abundance; large rising rates result in a significant improvement offish diversity, which is counterintuitive and against previous findings. The quantitative function developed by GP was further used to construct an indicator impact matrix (IIM), which was demonstrated as a potentially useful tool for streamflow restoration design.

abstract = {The use of scientometric techniques can assist in evaluating the importance of a subject, author or article, and also emphasize the trends and contributions of a discipline, scientist or research group, institution or country regarding world-wide scientific and technological advances. We applied scientometric analysis to papers in the Thomson ISI database, in order to understand temporal trends in phytoplankton research. From the years 1991 through 2005, the number of articles on this topic increased. We found 19,681 articles containing the word "phytoplankton" in the title, keyword and/or abstract. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize changes in the focus of papers published from 1991 to 2005. The keywords gradually changed, in the earliest years indicating descriptive study, whereas in recent years (2000 and after), the keywords became more diversified and related to aspects of technology, genetics, evolution and public health.},

@article{Moisan1996,
abstract = {A time- and depth-dependent, physical-bio-optical model was developed for the California coastal transition zone (CTZ) with the overall objective of understanding and quantifying the processes that contribute to the vertical and temporal development of nutrient and plankton distributions in the CTZ. The model food web components included silicate, nitrate, ammonium, two phytoplankton size fractions, copepods, doliolids, euphausiids, and a detritus pool. The wavelength-dependent subsurface irradiance field was attenuated by seawater and phytoplankton pigments. The one-dimensional (1-D) model adequately simulated the development and maintenance of a subsurface chlorophyll maximum in different regions within the CTZ. An analysis of the individual terms in the model governing equations revealed that phytoplankton in situ growth was primarily responsible for the creation and maintenance of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum at both coastal and oceanic regions in the CTZ. The depth to which the maximum in situ growth occurred was controlled by the combined effect of light and nutrient limitation. Also, the simulated bio-optical fields demonstrated the effect of nonlinear couplings between food web components and the subsurface irradiance field on vertical biological distributions. In particular, the e-folding scale of the subsurface photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) was influenced by the level of Zooplankton grazing.

@article{Uitz2006,
abstract = {The present study examines the potential of using the near-surface chlorophyll a concentration ([Chla]surf), as it can be derived from ocean color observation, to infer the column-integrated phytoplankton biomass, its vertical distribution, and ultimately the community composition. Within this context, a large High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment database was analyzed. It includes 2419 vertical pigment profiles, sampled in case 1 waters with various trophic states (0.03{\&}{\#}8211;6 mg Chla m{\&}{\#}8722;3). The relationships between [Chla]surf and the chlorophyll a vertical distribution, as previously derived by Morel and Berthon (1989), are fully confirmed. This agreement makes it possible to go further and to examine if similar relationships between [Chla]surf and the phytoplankton assemblage composition along the vertical can be derived. Thanks to the detailed pigment composition, and use of specific pigment biomarkers, the contribution to the local chlorophyll a concentration of three phytoplankton groups can be assessed. With some cautions, these groups coincide with three size classes, i.e., microplankton, nanoplankton and picoplankton. Corroborating previous regional findings (e.g., large species dominate in eutrophic environments, whereas tiny phytoplankton prevail in oligotrophic zones), the present results lead to an empirical parameterization applicable to most oceanic waters. The predictive skill of this parameterization is satisfactorily tested on a separate data set. With such a tool, the vertical chlorophyll a profiles of each group can be inferred solely from the knowledge of [Chla]surf. By combining this tool with satellite ocean color data, it becomes possible to quantify on a global scale the phytoplankton biomass associated with each of the three algal assemblages.},

abstract = {Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an important process for evaluating the effects of development, and to assist decisions to effectively manage potential deep-sea mining (DSM). However, although EIA is a widely used and accepted approach, there has been considerable debate over its effectiveness. In this paper, we summarise some of the key problems raised by previous EIA reviews, as well as examining several EIAs carried out in recent years for DSM, and highlight issues identified by management agencies. Scientific shortcomings are discussed, and recommendations provided on ways to improve performance. These include inadequate baseline data, insufficient detail of the mining operation, insufficient synthesis of data and the ecosystem approach, poor assessment and consideration of uncertainty, inadequate assessment of indirect impacts, inadequate treatment of cumulative impacts, insufficient risk assessment, and consideration of linkages between EIA and other management plans. The focus of the paper is on scientific limitations, but we also consider some aspects of their application to elements of process and policy.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton concentrations at the sea surface reduce CO2, increase O2 and indicate the abundance of fish. If they are well understood, there are enormous benefits. This study investigates the seasonal distribution of Chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton concentrations in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea by the created oceanic model and the satellite data obtained from Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The time-series and distribution of Chlorophyll-a concentration, phytoplankton absorption coefficient and Sea Surface Temperature are retrieved from Giovanni to analyze. The simulation is created from the seasonal winds to give the surface circulation as a result. The work is done to compare the satellite data and the simulation result. They are found to be agreed between SST, Chl-a concentration, phytoplankton absorption coefficient and ocean surface circulation. The study reaches the conclusion that the oceanic model can implicitly describe the seasonal distribution of Chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton concentrations in the domain of study.},

abstract = {Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is key to the robust environmental management of industrial projects; it is used to anticipate, assess and reduce environmental and social risks of a project. It is instrumental in project planning and execution, and often required for financing and regulatory approval to be granted. The International Seabed Authority currently requires an EIA for deep-sea mining (DSM) in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the Area), but the existing regulations present only a portion of a robust EIA process. This article presents an ideal EIA process for DSM, drawing upon the application of EIA from allied industries. It contains screening, scoping and assessment phases, along with the development of an environmental management plan. It also includes external review by experts, stakeholder consultation, and regulatory review. Lessons learned from application of EIA elsewhere are discussed in relation to DSM, including the integration of EIA into UK domestic law, and the reception of EIAs prepared for seabed ore extraction in the Exclusive Economic Zones of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Finally, four main challenges of implementing the EIA process to DSM in the Area are presented: 1) EIA process for DSM needs to incorporate mechanisms to address uncertainty; 2) detailed requirements for the EIA process phases should be made clear; 3) mechanisms are needed to ensure that the EIA influences decision making; and, 4) the EIA process requires substantial input and involvement from the regulator.},

abstract = {The composition of marine ecosystems is determined by spatial and temporal patterns of global biogeochemical cycles. Shifts in marine ecosystem composition driven by changes in climate can in turn affect biogeochemical cycles, especially through their impact on air-sea fluxes of CO 2 and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. However, the response of marine ecosystems to climate is difficult to assess at global scale due to the scarcity of large-scale in-situ biological monitoring programmes. Here, we combine and analyse remote-sensing observations, in-situ observations, and a global ocean biogeochemistry model to gain insight into interactions between marine ecosystem composition and climate variability over the last decade, in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. Our results show large-scale shifts in the dominance of diatoms, with mean anomalies 63.3{\%} higher during extreme positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation index compared to its extreme negative phases and with mean anomalies 134{\%} higher during extreme positive phases of Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Ocean over the period 1998-2008. Significant changes in the frequency of diatom dominance are detected concurrently in the three data sources studied. Model outputs indicate that this increase is driven by nutrient supply from deep waters during windier and more turbulent climate conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

To improve our understanding of the role of phytoplankton for marine ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles, information on the global distribution of major phytoplankton groups is essential. Although algorithms have been developed to assess phytoplankton diversity from space for over two decades, so far the application of these data sets has been limited. This scientific roadmap identifies user needs, summarizes the current state of the art, and pinpoints major gaps in long-term objectives to deliver space-derived phytoplankton diversity data that meets the user requirements. These major gaps in using ocean color to estimate phytoplankton community structure were identified as: (a) the mismatch between satellite, in situ and model data on phytoplankton composition, (b) the lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates provided with satellite data, (c) the spectral limitation of current sensors to enable the full exploitation of backscattered sunlight, and (d) the very limited applicability of satellite algorithms determining phytoplankton composition for regional, especially coastal or inland, waters. Recommendation for actions include but are not limited to: (i) an increased communication and round-robin exercises among and within the related expert groups, (ii) the launching of higher spectrally and spatially resolved sensors, (iii) the development of algorithms that exploit hyperspectral information, and of (iv) techniques to merge and synergistically use the various streams of continuous information on phytoplankton diversity from various satellite sensors' and in situ data to ensure long-term monitoring of phytoplankton composition.},
